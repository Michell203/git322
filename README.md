# git322
A Git-like version control system written in C++.

git322 has the following features:
1. Adding a version of the file when the user finds suitable.
2. Removing a version (any version that was being tracked).
3. Loading a specific version and making it the current active one.
4. Printing to the screen the list of all versions of the file.
5. Comparing any 2 versions of the file.
6. Searching and displaying all the versions having a specific keyword.

This was done as part of COMP 322 "Introduction to C++".
